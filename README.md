## Installation Instructions
1. Open the **Releases** tab on the right side of the page
2. Download the latest `.zip` file of the map  
   Example: `MCSR.Practice.vX.X.X.zip`
3. Unzip the file  
   I recommend WinRAR or 7zip to avoid file issues
4. Open the unzipped folder and verify the structure  
   There must be **no folder inside another folder**.
   If there is, drag the inner folder out
5. Move the map folder into the `saves` folder of your Minecraft instance.  
6. Start Minecraft and select the world. Minecraft Version 1.16.1!
   Start Practicing :)
